# Mingle Box - Coders And Project Hub
Coders & Project Hub is a marketplace where people who need custom software developed can find coders in a safe and business-friendly environment. Buyers can pick from a pool of registered coders...enabling them to hire a coder from the country or across the country from the comfort of their computers.

Coders and buyers both can be benefited from this Bidding. Buyers who wish to hire internationally, can take advantage of favorable overseas exchange rates, resulting in work being done for 50-90% less than if the project were done in-country.

Coders are also given access to a huge pool of potential work and have the ability to work independently from their homes rather than for a company .
